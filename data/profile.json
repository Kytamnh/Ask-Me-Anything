    "A Federated Learning Approach for Speech Anti-Spoofing and Deepfake Detection": "• Employed a wav2vec 2.0 frontend for feature extraction and a lightweight Multi-Scale Dilation Attention Network (MDAN) backend for multi-scale feature processing and classification. • Achieved 2.92% EER (equal error rate) and 0.2672 t-DCF (tandem detection cost function) on ASVspoof 2021 Logical Access and 2.99% EER on DeepFake partition, outperforming several centralized baselines.",
    "Photo to Monet Style Art (Style Transfer)": "• Developed an unpaired image-to-image translation model, aimed at learning a mapping of images from a source domain to a target domain without the need of paired images from the two domains to train on. • Used Cycle – Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) architecture."

I love to connect with new people and keep growing. Professionally, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern at Big Vision LLC (Bengaluru), where I built practical AI solutions. My interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and MLOps, and I enjoy building systems that actually work end-to-end. Outside work, I'm into piano, pickleball, and basically anything outdoors. My idea of success is simple: being happy with myself."
